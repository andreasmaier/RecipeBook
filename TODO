TODO:
- Generated by, pumped by, consumes for boilers
- Memoization of entry properties
- Go through listboxes list below and implement those that are missing.
- Search pane filtering by a specified list and other filtering options.
- Improve behavior when other GUIs are open (overlay instead of replace).
- Show group description when hovering the title

CONSIDERING:
- Reverse-research?
- Flib GUI components (other than technology button)?
- Show descriptions stuff in info panes?
- Search technologies?

BUGS:
- Alt+click on item-on-ground doesn't work.
- Research time is wrong.

API additions:
- get_filtered_entity_prototypes:
    - ingredient_limit
    - add characters to crafting_category filter
    - energy source filters (type, fuel category, fluid, etc)

All list boxes from 3.0 - not all will be re-added:
