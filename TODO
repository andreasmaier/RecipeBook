TODO:
- Refactor the database.
- Custom prototype properties for overrides etc.
- Technology pages (tech screen pauses the game and prevents any nice logic).
- Go through listboxes list below and implement those that are missing.
- Search pane filtering by a specified list and other filtering options.

BUGS:
- Alt+click on item-on-ground doesn't work.

API additions:
- get_filtered_entity_prototypes:
    - ingredient_limit
    - add characters to crafting_category filter
    - energy source filters (type, fuel category, fluid, etc)

All list boxes from 3.0 - not all will be re-added:
